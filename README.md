This project is a simple CRA project used to demonstrate features of LambdaGenie, JavaScript Rules Engine, Intelligent Feature Flags, and Configuration Management

# LambdaGenie

LambdaGenie is a JavaScript Rules Engine, Intelligent Feature Flags, and Configuration Management. It is a simple, lightweight, and easy to use library that can be used to manage your application's feature flags, configuration, and rules. It can be used in both the browser and Node.js. More information can be found at [https://lambdagenie.com](https://lambdagenie.com)


# Getting Started

Although not required, it is recommended you sign up for a free account at [https://lambdagenie.com](https://lambdagenie.com) to get started. This will allow you to create your own feature flags, configuration, and rules. Instructions on how to do this can be found at [https://lambdagenie.com/docs/intro](https://lambdagenie.com/docs/intro)

## Installation
Once you have created your account, you can install the LambdaGenie library using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install 
```

```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

You can start running this demo application simply by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the application and open a browser window to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can then click on the dropdown in the top right corner to select different users and see how the feature flags and configuration change based on the user's attributes.

## Configuration

This sample application comes pre-configured with a config file located at `src/config.json`. This file contains the LambdaGenie configuration. You can update this file with your own LambdaGenie config.
